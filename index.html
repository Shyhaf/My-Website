              <h3>Rogue Pickings Website</h3>
              <p>I recreated a basic photoshop image into the beautiful web page you see now. This project relied solely on HTML5 and CSS.</p>
              <h3>Jubilee Austen Project</h3>  
              <p>This was my first effort at creating a web page and coming to grips with HTML5 & CSS. I have long since become proficient in both HTML & CSS</p>

                <h2>about me</h2>
                <p>Hi there! I’m Rose, a web developer, code enthusiast, and a lover of good jokes. Also, I’m a cat, nine lives and counting. :)</p>
                <p>Nine lives is a long time so I’ve got to live in four different countries, and travel across four continents. I’m a patchwork of the best parts of many cultures, or at least I like to think so. What I love the most about my background is how easy it is for me to relate to people from all over the world, and to understand the varied needs of my clients. Makes it that much easier to catch your vision, put my paws to work and turn your dream into a killer website.</p>
                <p>Nine lives means that I’ve also had time to learn all sorts of useful stuff. I have a bachelor’s degree in Communication, a master’s degree in International Management, and many years of experience as a manager. This means that when you hire me, you don’t just get an awesome cat that codes pretty well but one who can help you shape your content, understands business strategy, has a strong work ethic, and great skills.</p>
